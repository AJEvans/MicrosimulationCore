MicrosimulationCore
===================

Stripped-down version of a microsimulation algorithm

Main is Distributor.java.

These classes exemplify the core of a Spatial Microsimulation package using Simulated Annealing. 
They're kind of cut down and restructured version of the SimLeeds reweighter classes by Dimitris Ballas:
